This simple tool is made on pure bash.

It's allow to do simple actions on many server like:

1. take or put some thing to servers.

2. run single command from line or mass commands from file to servers.

Why and for?

Because i could not use any exist tool to administration many server. 
I can't, becouse our customer are really specific and does not allow to installing any extra packages on live servers. So in this case i made this little program.

How it's work?

1. Copy code to some file, make this file executable 
exemple: chmod u+x /path/to/the/file.sh or chmod 500 /path/to/the/file.sh

2. Run file from command line with one of options.
exemple: /path/to/the/file.sh -c

3. Follow the text menu

Options:
-p put some thing to the servers
-c some command to servers
-g get some thing from the servers
